The fundamental reason for this application is convenience, speed and
cost. Having a large pedal board full of effects is heavy and large.
When there is a problem with a cable or battery it takes time to find
it.  When you want to change the sound it usually means purchasing and
learning a new pedal and finding as well as finding place for it.

Basically the LiveMusicApp is a midi router and while is can be run
standalone. The more convenient usage is to have it bundled with
analog and sound font software on a boot-able USB stick. The allows
virtually any PC with, or without,  a USB audio interface to be
rebooted with the USB stick and used in place of a heavy pedal board.
Before we get into the details here are a few screen shots of the
current working model booted from a stick. The software currently uses
an analog effects processor (rakarrack), midi font player
(fluidsynth). multiple channel looper (sooperlooper), drum machine
(hydrogen), MP3 player (clementine) and guitar tab editor (TuxGuitar).
However all of these are configurable so that they can be changed
based on the preferences of the user.

The name of the application is:
LiveMusicApp

The Script GuitarEffects will make all of the connections with the 
other Apps, but it is still being generalized.

In order to view PDF files in the charts tab you need to install the browser-plugin-evince. Here is a link to a deb.

The start up and connections scripts are still too 
tied to my setup so I will work on those and release
them shortly.
